<p>The large images that appear at the top of the content are managed from the Media Library</p>
<p><strong>Home page</strong> – On the home page, you have a set of rotating images. This is called a ‘stage’.  The files pertinent to this stage are found in the media library and are named stage1.jpg, stage2.jpg, all the way up to stage9.jpg.  The naming convention is extremely important, as is the order of steps you take to replace an image.  To replace a stage image, you first prepare your replacement image.  Second, you delete from the Media Library, the image you want to replace.  Third, “add new” file to the Media Library.  This new file is the replacement file, and must be named exactly the same as the old file you just deleted.  After you upload the file, be sure to change the ‘Folder’ to the ‘home-stages’ directory.  That’s it, your done!</p>
<p><strong>Secondary pages</strong> – On some pages like the Hours &amp; Locations, and Reservations pages, you’ll see that there are large images at the top of the page.  These are managed in the Media Library in a similar fashion as the above Home page stage images.  The naming convention is slightly different, but the steps you take are identical.  The naming convention for these files is the name of the page as seen in the URL plus ‘-large’.  For example, the name of the Hours &amp; Locations page image is ‘hours-locations-large.jpg’. To replace a secondary page image, you first prepare your replacement image.  Second, you delete from the Media Library, the image you want to replace.  Third, “add new” file to the Media Library.  This new file is the replacement file, and must be named exactly the same as the old file you just deleted.  After you upload the file, be sure to change the ‘Folder’ to the ‘secondary-pages’ directory.  That’s it, your done!</p>
