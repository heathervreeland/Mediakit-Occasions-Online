<p>Widgets are bits of functionality that can be placed in various sections of the website.  There are two sections on this page; the ‘Available Widgets’ section, and the list of ‘Sidebars’.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Available Widgets – this is where you find widgets that are available to you for use in the ‘Sidebars’.</li>
  <li>Sidebars – these are programmed in to allow you to place widgets on specific pages in specific locations.  Each sidebar is named according to the page and/or section that they are placed.  For instance, the first sidebar is called ‘Home Page Nav’.  This is the sidebar that appears just below the navigation on the homepage of your website.  It currently contains and Image Widget with the awards logos.
    <ul>
      <li>Left Home Page Header, and Right Home Page Header are the sidebars used to insert the four images on the homepage that appear just below the stages.  See notes below on how to add or change images.  Please note that you need a title and link on these images, unlike the sidebar images below.
      <li>The rest of the sidebars represent the right side columns of any pages that don’t have a large top image.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How to add a sidebar images</h3> 
<p>The right sidebar images are placed by using Image Widgets.  The site is already populated with images. These images can be added, changed, the order re-arranged, or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>To add an image</strong> - find the correct sidebar and expand it.  Drag an Image Widget from the center section of Available Widgets to the sidebar you want to add an image to.  If there are widgets already in the sidebar, you can choose the order in which they appear with standard drag and drop functionality.  After you’ve added the widget, expand the Image Widget and click on Add Image.  Choose the image from the Media Library, or upload a new image.  Once you find the correct image, click ‘Show’, then click on the ‘Insert Into Widget’ button.  You then need to remove the title and the link so that the title and link don’t show up.  Click save and your done!</p>
<p><strong>To change an image</strong> - find the correct sidebar and expand it.  Expand the Image Widget that you want to change.  Click on Change Image, and choose a new image to place.  You will need to remove the title, and link so that they don’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>To delete and image</strong> - simply expand the Image Widget you’d like to remove, then click ‘delete’ at the bottom of it.</p>
<p><strong>To re-order images</strong> - simply drag and drop them in the order you prefer.</p>
